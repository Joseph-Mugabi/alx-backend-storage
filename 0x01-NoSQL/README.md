# 0x01-NoSQL

```
MongoDB is a NoSQL database. "NoSQL" stands for "Not Only SQL," 
and it refers to a category of databases that do not use the traditional 
tabular relational database model (SQL). Instead, they offer flexible data models,
typically allowing for unstructured or semi-structured data, and use different data 
storage mechanisms, like key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores.

MongoDB, specifically, is a popular document-based NoSQL database. It stores data 
in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which allows for rich data structures, nested arrays, 
and key-value pairs within a single document. MongoDB is often chosen for its scalability, 
flexibility, and ease of use, especially in scenarios where the data structure may evolve 
over time.

Redis: A fast, in-memory key-value store that is often used for caching and real-time data processing.

Cassandra: A wide-column store designed for high availability, fault tolerance, and linear scalability.

Couchbase: A key-value store with support for JSON documents, providing both caching
and database capabilities.

Neo4j: A graph database that excels in managing and querying highly interconnected data.
